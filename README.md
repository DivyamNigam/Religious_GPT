A Gpt Trained on Bible
Just a funny experiment to see what would happen if you could talk to Bible, so the raw file is just bible.txt and The bot is coded to have a loop so it will have a continuous conversation until you type "exit".
It does repeat words in its answers, I cant figure out why tho. But its custom tuned.It does not have any math, no calculation can be done.

To talk to bot take the .ipynb file and just run it on google collab in GPU runtime.
